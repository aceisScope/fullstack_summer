### In the reposotary there are the course work and the final project.

To run the final project, first node modules need to be installed locally since they're ignored in git repo. 

Then start mongodb service. On Mac OS the command is `brew services stop mongodb-community@4.2`, depending on the mongoDB version. 

Then simple open /project/mean-stack, do `node app.js`, then open http://localhost:3000.
First you may need to register as a new user.
